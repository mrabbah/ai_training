    "# YOLO: Detection Using A Pre-Trained Model\n",
    "1. Installing The Base System\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet\n",
    "cd darknet\n",
    "make\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. You already have the config file for YOLO in the cfg/ subdirectory. You will have to download the pre-trained weight file (258 MB):\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Then run the detector!:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detect cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights data/dog.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "in terminal you will got output like this:\n",
    "![Output dtection command](images/yolooutput1.png)\n",
    "You will got also an a image that illustrates the predictions :\n",
    "![Prediction](images/predictions1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tiny YOLO:\n",
    "Tiny YOLO is based off of the Darknet reference network and is much faster but less accurate than the normal YOLO model. To use the version trained on VOC:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/tiny-yolo-voc.weights\n",
    "./darknet detector test cfg/voc.data cfg/tiny-yolo-voc.cfg tiny-yolo-voc.weights data/dog.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which, ok, it's not perfect, but On GPU it runs at >200 FPS:\n",
    "![Prediction](images/predictions2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Real-Time Detection on a Webcam\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO THIS PART MUST BE DONE AGAIN WHEN I CAN UPDATE XCODE\n",
    "Running YOLO on test data isn't very interesting if you can't see the result. Instead of running it on a bunch of images let's run it on the input from a webcam!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install OpenCV in Mac:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "brew tap homebrew/science\n",
    "brew install opencv3\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. To run this demo you will need to compile Darknet with CUDA and OpenCV. Then run the command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detector demo cfg/coco.data cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Training YOLO on VOC\n",
    "If you want to play with different training regimes, hyper-parameters, or datasets. Here's how to get it working on the Pascal VOC dataset.\n",
    "1. Get The Pascal VOC Data\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "mkdir PascalVOCData\n",
    "cd PascalVOCData/\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "tar xf VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar\n",
    "tar xf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "tar xf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "```\n",
    "There will now be a VOCdevkit/ subdirectory with all the VOC training data in it.\n",
    "2. Generate Labels for VOC\n",
    "Now we need to generate the label files that Darknet uses. Darknet wants a .txt file for each image with a line for each ground truth object in the image that looks like:\n",
    "**<object-class> <x> <y> <width> <height>**\n",
    "Where x, y, width, and height are relative to the image's width and height. To generate these file we will run the voc_label.py script in Darknet's scripts/ directory."
