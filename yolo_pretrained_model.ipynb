    "# YOLO: Detection Using A Pre-Trained Model\n",
    "1. Installing The Base System\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet\n",
    "cd darknet\n",
    "make\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. You already have the config file for YOLO in the cfg/ subdirectory. You will have to download the pre-trained weight file (258 MB):\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Then run the detector!:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detect cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights data/dog.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "in terminal you will got output like this:\n",
    "![Output dtection command](images/yolooutput1.png)\n",
    "You will got also an a image that illustrates the predictions :\n",
    "![Prediction](images/predictions1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tiny YOLO:\n",
    "Tiny YOLO is based off of the Darknet reference network and is much faster but less accurate than the normal YOLO model. To use the version trained on VOC:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/tiny-yolo-voc.weights\n",
    "./darknet detector test cfg/voc.data cfg/tiny-yolo-voc.cfg tiny-yolo-voc.weights data/dog.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which, ok, it's not perfect, but On GPU it runs at >200 FPS:\n",
    "![Prediction](images/predictions2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Real-Time Detection on a Webcam\n",
    "\n",
    "Running YOLO on test data isn't very interesting if you can't see the result. Instead of running it on a bunch of images let's run it on the input from a webcam!\n",
    "You will need a webcam connected to the computer that OpenCV can connect to or it won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install OpenCV in Mac:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "brew tap homebrew/science\n",
    "brew install opencv3\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. change the 2nd line of the Makefile to read:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "nano Makefile\n",
    "```\n",
    "![Makefile screen shot](images/makefilescreenshot.png)\n",
    "3. re-make the project. Then use the imtest routine to test image loading and displaying:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "make\n",
    "./darknet imtest data/eagle.jpg\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you get a bunch of windows with eagles in them you've succeeded! (now we are using opencv with darknet)\n",
    "4. To run this demo you will need to compile Darknet with CUDA and OpenCV (steps 1,2,3 above).  Then run the command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detector demo cfg/coco.data cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights\n",
    "```\n",
    "the result in my case were like this : \n",
    "![Real time detection webcam](images/rtdetectionwebcam.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run it on a video file if OpenCV can read the video:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detector demo cfg/coco.data cfg/yolo.cfg yolo.weights ../videos/video_640_480_15.h264\n",
    "```\n",
    "to get bettere perfromence you can run this command : \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "./darknet detector demo cfg/coco.data cfg/tiny-yolo-voc.cfg tiny-yolo-voc.weights ../videos/video_640_480_15.h264 \n",
    "```\n",
